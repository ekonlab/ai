## datasaurus multiclass



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(datasauRus)

datasaurus_dozen

```
Plot them.

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = dataset)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 5)
```

But their summary statistics are so similar.

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarise(across(c(x, y), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)),
    x_y_cor = cor(x, y)
  )
```

Letâ€™s explore whether we can use modeling to predict which dataset a point belongs to. This is not a large dataset compared to the number of classes (13!) so this isnâ€™t a tutorial that shows best practices for a predictive modeling workflow overall, but it does demonstrate how to evaluate a multiclass model, as well as a bit about how random forest models work.


```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```
